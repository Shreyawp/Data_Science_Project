### [Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models on Wine Quality Data](https://github.com/Shreyawp/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/Wine%20Quality.ipynb)
- The Wine Quality dataset is a popular dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing physicochemical attributes of red and white wine samples. 
- Each sample is labeled with a quality score ranging from 0 to 10, based on sensory assessments by wine tasters. 
- The dataset includes 11 chemical features such as alcohol, pH, density, and residual sugar, which can be used to predict wine quality. 
- This dataset is ideal for supervised learning tasks like classification and regression to explore the impact of chemical properties on wine quality and develop predictive models for quality control in wine production.
- Using GridSearchCV, the best parameters are evaluated for model performance. The decision tree achieved accuracy of 55% for the wine quality data.

### [IMDb Movie Revenue Prediction](https://github.com/Shreyawp/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/IMDb%20Movie%20Revenue%20Prediction.ipynb)
- This project aims to predict the worldwide revenue of movies using the IMDB dataset.
- The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, remove currency symbols, and normalize data.
- Key features like budget, runtime, genre, and release year were used, and additional features were engineered for improved performance.
- Regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost were trained and evaluated using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
- Insights into the most significant factors influencing movie revenue were visualized, highlighting the importance of budget and release year.
